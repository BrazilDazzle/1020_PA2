NOTE: All changes to code should be listed in this README for organization.
All new code should be well-commented and summarized in this README

//---PART 1: Converting from Pixel* to vector<Pixel>---//
In Image.cpp
-Every instance of Pixel* return types or parameters changed to vectors
-copy functions modified using .begin() and .end() iterators
-'new' replaced with PIX.reserve or with size specification in vector
  declaration
-delete[] PIX changed to PIX.clear()
-pixels[i] syntax left unchanged when converting to vectors
NOTE: Unsure if we need to write driver listed at the end of part 1. Check
with TA.

//---PART 2: Constructor initialization list---//
In Header.cpp, Image.cpp, Pixel.cpp
-All constructors converted to initializer lists
NOTE: Image::Image (const Image& img) only partially converted because of
functions like copy and reserve, as well as a non-member variable. Check with
TA to make sure explanation is good.

//---PART 3: Sharpen Filter---//
